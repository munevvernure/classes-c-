	//What would happen if we want to create more users?
	//A constructer is a special type of method that is invoked each time that an object of a class is created 
	//There is three rules to create a constructor 
	//a constructor does not have a return type,
	//a constructor has the same name with the class it belongs to
	//a constructor must be public
